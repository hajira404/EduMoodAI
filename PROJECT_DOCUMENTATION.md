# EduMoodAI - Project Documentation

## Project Overview

### Description
EduMoodAI is an innovative mood-based learning path recommender that personalizes educational content based on users' current emotional states. The platform uses AI-driven content curation to match learning materials with users' moods, creating a more effective and engaging learning experience.

### Purpose
The project addresses the challenge of one-size-fits-all learning approaches by:
- **Emotional Intelligence in Learning**: Recognizing that emotional state significantly impacts learning effectiveness
- **Personalized Content Delivery**: Providing tailored learning experiences based on mood analysis
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitoring learning patterns and emotional trends over time
- **Adaptive Learning**: Adjusting content difficulty and type based on user's current capacity

### Problem Statement
Traditional learning platforms ignore the crucial role of emotions in learning. Students often struggle with:
- Mismatched content difficulty with current mental capacity
- Lack of motivation due to inappropriate content timing
- No consideration of emotional readiness for different types of learning
